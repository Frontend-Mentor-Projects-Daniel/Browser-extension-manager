## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to the **Browser Extensions Manager** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). This was a fun and insightful project where I explored advanced frontend architecture, accessibility, and layout composition.

## Overview

This project is a responsive, accessible browser extensions manager interface. I focused on **Clean Architecture**, **CUBE CSS**, and **Every Layout** principles to organize styles and logic cleanly.

**Key goals:**

- Semantic, accessible HTML
- Scalable CSS architecture (CUBE + BEM)
- Maintainable JS code following separation of concerns

---

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS (CUBE architecture + BEM naming)

## Features

Users can:

- âœ… Toggle extensions between active and inactive
- âœ… Filter by status (active/inactive)
- âœ… Remove extensions from the list
- âœ… Switch between light/dark themes
- âœ… Experience responsive layout for all device sizes
- âœ… See focus/hover states for all interactive elements

---

## What I Learned

- **Using Every Layout to compose or create all the layouts**

- **CUBE CSS**: Component-first styling with predictable utilities

- **Clean Architecture**:

  - Domain logic separated from UI
  - No HTML-in-JS; dynamic content managed via `data.json`

- **Theming**: Switched themes using `[data-theme]` + CSS custom properties

- **Gradients**: CSS can't animate them directly; used `Granim.js`
